    				<p class="img polaroid"> Hello!<br> 
    					<br>
    					Welcome, Treasuered reader;
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					This post is my first offical blog post on my brand new website. Just a few small things beforing diving
    					into what is going on. This website is a showcase for my webdesign skills and to share my intellectual skills. Additionally, it is a living portfolio of my design, and on going informatic work. Finally, I may 
    					put a few sketches up here too. So lets get into the meat and patatoes of this website starting with goals.
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					So my goals with this blog are to act as an open creative space where I can share a few things about what 
    					I have learned about informatics, information design and information artcitecture. These areas are my main
    					areas of academic interest. I am looking to apply these skills into the healthcare industry. I have been 
    					very lucky to have experience working in areas that have taught me how to tell stories, design pages, and
    					above all, the great importance of the "eye for detail" regarding the visual arts.
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					My next step is to finish my formal education with my masters degree. I currently, in my final semester of graduate school and focusing on my career after graduation. In the mean time, I am working a few projects until my final research project is due. Mainly, professional development and creating a business plan. I have a few ideas brewing for my research projectt. Until then I am working on becoming a better professional and launching a business.
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					While I did not indent to create a business when I entered graduate school it is part of the course work. So I might as well pour a little money into it to allow it to grow into something. It seems a waste to go 
    					through the effort of creating a business plan just to let it collect dust after it class is over. This time of course work allows me time in order to thing about creating a business of my own before going 
    					forward working at an informatics department. I think it is a benefitical opportunity to allow skills 
    					besides technical skills to grow. I am excited to plan and strategize business ideas. And execute.
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					One final note. I am very proud and satisfied with myself for developing technical skills durring my course work as a graduate student. I am satisfied I enrolled in analytical courses and succeeded. As a creative person who wasn't always the best at math and science, I am deeply honored to have developed the small level of technical skills in SQL, HTML and CSS that I have. In addition, I am delighted to have developed skills in statistics and math in general. Plus, I am catering a new found love for physics and higher levels or computation. I am excited to see where this future takes me as I am certain it is the path I was always meant to walk. 
    					<br>
    					<br>
    					I am proud of myself for coding this website, the databased I've made for class projects and the few contracted coding tasks I completed undercontract. While 10 years ago this place is not where I envisioned where I would be I am confident it is authentic.
